# Data Mining

**Overview**

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers, to predict tumor malignancy based on a comprehensive cancer dataset. By analyzing various features of tumors, the goal is to accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant. This predictive model can significantly aid in early detection and treatment decisions, potentially improving patient outcomes in oncology.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains relevant features and labels associated with tumor samples. Each instance includes characteristics such as tumor radius, perimeter, and texture, along with the corresponding diagnosis of benign or malignant.

**Methodology**

Data Preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing steps were conducted to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.

Model Training: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers were implemented. The models were trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.

**Results**

The trained models achieved promising results in predicting tumor malignancy, with accuracy rates and other evaluation metrics documented in the project's codebase.
